# how-to

this app has been bootstrapped with `vite` CLI, using `pnpm` 10.14.0 and `node` 22.19.0. Any reasonably recent version of the above should work just as well, same as regular `npm` (hasn't been tested though). To run the app, install the dependencies and run `build` and then `preview` scripts, so assuming pnpm usage:

1. `pnpm install`
2. `pnpm run build`
3. `pnpm run preview`

ALternatively, you can look at the deployed version at https://amazing-gelato-713653.netlify.app/
